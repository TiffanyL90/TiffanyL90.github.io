	<h2> About Me </h2>

	<p> Hi there! I'm Tiffany Lim and this is my first webpage. This page is a project for a coding class I am taking in order to expand my skillset to take on new roles/challenges. </p>

	<p>
		Here is a little more about me. I live in Chicago and I work as global mobility consultant for a large firm. I was born and raised in Chicago but my heritage is Chinese-Burmese. I have an identical twin sister and also one younger sister. </p>
